You are an expert web developer and medical expert-system designer.

Build a complete website (frontend + backend logic) that works as a safe
Medical Expert System for symptom checking. 

The website must follow these rules:

1. The system should NOT prescribe exact medical drugs or dosages.
2. It may suggest general OTC categories (e.g., “antacid”, “pain reliever like paracetamol”).
3. It must suggest possible conditions based on symptoms without diagnosing.
4. It must ALWAYS ask follow-up questions for missing info.
5. It must ALWAYS show red-flag warnings and when to see a doctor.
6. It must include a clear medical disclaimer.

Website Requirements:
---------------------
**Frontend:**
- Modern, responsive UI (React / Next.js or your best choice)
- Clean input box where user enters symptoms
- A button: “Analyze Symptoms”
- Results section showing:
  - Possible conditions (with reasoning)
  - OTC categories
  - Home remedies
  - Follow-up questions
  - Emergency warning conditions
- Light/Dark mode toggle
- Professional medical theme

**Backend / Logic:**
- Implement a rule-based expert system:
  - IF symptoms match → THEN return list of possible conditions
  - Use probability-based language (e.g., “may indicate”, “possibly”)
  - Provide general OTC categories (no prescriptions)
  - Never give exact dosages
- Add structured JSON output:
  {
    conditions: [],
    reasoning: [],
    otcs: [],
    homeRemedies: [],
    followUpQuestions: [],
    redFlags: []
  }

**Features:**
- Search symptoms
- View suggestions
- Clear button
- Optional: Save previous symptom checks locally

**Safety Rules (MANDATORY):**
- No prescription drugs
- No medical certainty
- Add disclaimer: “Not a substitute for professional medical diagnosis.”
